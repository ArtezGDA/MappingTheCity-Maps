### Results

The result of all the scraping is a map off Images called **`myimages`** and JSON file called **`Theft-alerts-text.json`**. [JSON file](theft-alerts.json)

###### myimage map is a map with *stolen artworks images*. 

Not all images are placed in the map because some images have the same name that gives errors. 


###### The JSON file is a list with *stolen artworks*. 
For each stolen artwork there are the following keys:

- `Location`: the date off each stolen artwork.
	- `lon` the coordinate x.
	- `lat` the coordinate y.
- `Categorie`: the image link of off each stolen artwork.
- `ID`: What kind of artwork and the name who has made it.
- `CrimeRef`: the place where it is stolen and in there:
- `nItemsStolen`: from the person or company that the artwork belongs too.

The `Date`, `lon/lat` and `Title` are not included but it will be soon.
