#brooklyn ny data poster


#iteration 1

We found date from: new york city data, in the data where all the assautls in new york from allot of years writtin down. 
We scraped the date into jaso files but the file was way to big so we filterd it to the hours and crimes. 

With knowing that we wanted to do something with the hours and crimes i made this first iteration of how i wanted my poster to look.

#iteration 2

Than we started to scrap more and with plot divice we came to the next bargraphs:

this wasnt good because the data is not clear enough to read and not easy to understand. It was to vage.
