# Type of Celltowers

## Concept
I was wondering is people are aware of how many celltowers there actually are around them? This project is based on the Netherlands. I wanted to make an overview of all the celltowers and their place and what kind of type celltower it was. 

##Sketches

The first sketch was meant to see what happened with a thin line.

A thicker line.

Change of color.
![](sketch-png/4.png)
Spreading and size.
![](sketch-png/5.png)
More matching colors.
![](sketch-png/6.png)
Smaller dots.
![](sketch-png/7.png)
Bigger with opacity.
![](sketch-png/8.png)
Less opacity.
![](sketch-png/9.png)
More opacity.

How will it work with a white background.

##Poster-sketches
I wanted to show in strong visual way what the placement of all these celltowers are. So you have a nice overview where and which type of celltower. 

There also a little data on how many data there is collected and a diagram of the comparison in quantity.
