# CELL TOWERS 

### in the Netherlands




### JSON file
The json file that I used, contains of the following information:

-	city - Location
- 	type - Type celltower
-	coordinates_la - lattitude
-	coordinates_lo - longitude
-	x - x position
-	y - y position
-	ant_height - the height of the antenna
	
For my code I used the location, the coordinates lattidude and longtitude and the x and y position. 

Here I will put a link that will direct you to the JSON file: https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Data/tree/master/Celltowers

### Idea

For my data poster I wanted to show the accumulation of the celltowers in the Netherlands because there are so many. So I started to played with the transparency of the dots that represent the celltowers.

![](images/towersOnMap_09-1.png)

But in these sketches you can see that it became really hard to distinguish the dots. So I thought about seperating the different information in mutiple poster.

![](images/towersOnMap_500-1.png)
![](images/towersOnMap_600-1.png)
![](images/towersOnMap_700-1.png)
![](images/towersOnMap_800-1.png)
![](images/towersOnMap_900-1.png)

After my these sketches it became clear to me that the best way to represent all the celltowers was to make a heat map.Because then you would see how many there actually are.

### The final poster

I kept the final poster really simple. I made a few iterations, but in the end decided to stay with a normal heat map.

And this is my final poster:
