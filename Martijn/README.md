#martijn

This repository will hold the individual design work for the [Mapping the City](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/Course-Material/blob/master/MappingTheCity.md) assignment.

The repository is still empty, but will soon contain a folder per each student.

We found a json file wich contained factory accidents, the types of accidents and also the types of the of accidents and we wanted to visualise this given.

so we started sketching, together with the json file
[data](data.json)[factory_accidents](province_accidents4.json)


at first we had a code that enabled us to draw a litle map and [1](1.png)

we started to develop that map, it shows the accidents per province.

Then i wanted that the mapdots grow in size together with the amount of accidents that happened.
[driehoeken](driehoeken.png)We tried to rotate some of them so they would show us the position where the province is at. [worldmap10](worldmap10.pdf)

the triangels would only show all accidents they do not show the different types of accidents.

So we started to work on that. at first with a bar graph,[bargraph](bargraph.png) then we arranged them 
and made some sketches

the 

then we made the map [bargraphtypes](bargraphtypes.png) then i made some udjustements so the unformation becomes more clear,
